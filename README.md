# Country Layer API Demo using create-react-app

## Update to [this](https://github.com/SankThomas/rest-countries-api) repository

Restcountries.eu is now called countrylayer API. They've updated their terms of use and introduced a subscription based service - with a free tier of course, limited to 100 requests per day. You need an access key in order to query data from the API.

This repository is an update to my YouTube tutorial where I used the Rest Countries API to build a project. Of course the video is now obsolete because the API request in that video will no longer work. (Update video coming soon)
